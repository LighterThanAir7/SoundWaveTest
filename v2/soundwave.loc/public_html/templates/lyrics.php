I\'m here
Where endless meets the end
Do you see me?
I\'m hidden here again
Your whisper found its way
Calling me to stay

I\'m standing at the edge
<span class="text-primary-100">But something always brings me back</span>
All the voices in my head
Reminding me of what I have

If I fall tonight
You can bring me back to life
If I fall tonight
You can be my saving light

You can be my saving light
You can be my saving light

You can be my saving light

You\'re here
Like lightning in my veins
Now they see me
And they\'ll never be insane
Your whispers found its way
Calling me to stay

You can be my saving light

I\'m standing at the edge
But something always brings me back
All the voices in my head
Reminding of what I have

If I fall tonight
You can bring me back to life
If I fall tonight
You can be my saving light

You can be my saving light
You can be my saving light

You can be my saving light
You can be my saving light
