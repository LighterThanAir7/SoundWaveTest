# SoundWave
Music streaming platform made as a college project. It was developed in multiple stages, reconstructed from scratch two times as I expanded my knowledge and experience in web development.
It's far from a finished product but the idea was fully mine. 

Project started as a brief idea which I expanded on in my [Case Study](SoundWave%20-%20Case%20Study.pdf) and [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/r17i8EyIzbl08ecTmZdIOM/SoundWave-Projekt?type=design&node-id=30-90&mode=design)

I also did a video presentation on the Case Study which you can find [here](https://www.loom.com/share/002a756871b443788e64f6942fad0f11?sid=962c0854-8c02-4ef0-b650-0c58c853a31a).

#### By this time I created **v1** of the project.
- applied existing scheme from figma to frontend
- no functionalities

#### As I gained more and more experience I decided to start again from scratch and make V2 of the project.
- custom scss
- frontend redesign
- added working music player
- started working on backend

I also created a new presentation for the project with some **key new featues** that you can check out [here](SoundWave%20Project.pdf).

## Note
The project is still in development and I'm planning to switch PHP components and make them with React.
Also I will try to create an actual recommendation system depending on what the user preferences are and so much more...

This will be my final project which will determine my graduation so I'm going to give my best in it.
